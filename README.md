## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio website! This website was developed using a combination of cutting-edge technologies to create a visually stunning and engaging experience for visitors.

### Technologies Used
To build this site, I used the following technologies:

- Vite: a lightning-fast build tool that allowed me to develop and deploy the site quickly and efficiently.
- Three.js: a powerful JavaScript library that allowed me to create 3D animations and graphics that really bring the site to life.
- Email.js: a service that enabled contact form submissions to be sent directly to my email inbox.
- Framer Motion: a popular animation library for React, to create smooth and elegant transitions between pages and elements on the site.
- Tailwind CSS: a utility-first CSS framework that helped me to create a beautiful and consistent design across all screen sizes and devices.
- React-Toastify: a notification library used to display notification messages in response to user interactions.
